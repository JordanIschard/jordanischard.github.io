## Position

I am currently in my fourth year of PhD at the university of Orléans. My supervisors are [Frédéric Loulergue](https://frederic.loulergue.eu/), [Frédéric Dabrowski](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/Frederic.Dabrowski/) and [Jules Chouquet](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/membres/chouquet/).  In addition, I am a support for research engineer since October 2024 in the [AcceptAlgo](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/projets/Acceptabilit%C3%A9%20des%20algorithmes) project.

## Research topics

My PhD focuses on the verification of reactive programming languages and, more specifically, on functional reactive programming (FRP) languages with imperative features. I am interested in the FRP languages, like Yampa which is purely functional, and their extension with side effects or real parallelism. I use a proof assistant called Coq/Rocq to guarantee my results. I also work on the transformation of parallel programs verified in this same proof assistant.

_To summarize, I am interested in formal verification (for languages as well as programs), proof assistant usage and language semantics._
